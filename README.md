# CS162_F20_Lab3

This lab applies to lab 3 and lab 4. Ignore copy constructor and operation overloading if you are on lab 2.

Key concepts:
- Creating a class
- Constructors (default, parameterized)
- Destructors (handling memory)
- Accessors (getters)
- Mutators (setters)
- Copy Constructors (function returns, function pass-by-value, and instantiation)
- Operation overloading (key differences from copy constructor)
- Handling dynamic memory (constructors and destructors)
- Understanding pointers and array of pointers in-depth
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Memory allocation of classes
- Similarities to structs
- Constant parameters and constant references
- Access modifiers (public, private, and protected)
- Scope resolution operator (::)
- the "this" pointer, aka, the self-ness of an object.

If you are not comfortable with the above topics, please come to my office hours:
